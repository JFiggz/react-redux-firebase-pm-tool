## Pro Manage - Project Management Tool (React, Redux, Firebase)
This single page application was developed as a learning project. 

Pro Manage is a project management tool that provides users with an easy way to track, manage and collaborate on projects from a centralized dashboard. 

## Motivation
The motivation for development of this application was to learn new technologies. I wanted to develop hands on experience with Redux and Firebase/Firestore.
